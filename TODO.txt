- Allow for custom reaction templates to be built. To do this need to be able to generate atom mapped product (generalized version of merge())
    IDEA: can store reacting atom map numbers as dicts where keys = 'other' or 'self' where other means that it reacts with another
    molecule and 'self' means it is an intra molecular reaction and values are pairs of numbers. If pair is under 'other' then first number reprsents atom map number of self's reacting atom
    and the second number is the map number of the other molecules reacting atom. If pair is under 'self' both numbers correspond to reacting atoms on self.
    Pairs of numbers along with side chain and template would be stored in anotehr collection possibly.
- 3D rendering; look into pymol and using coordinate matricies from rdkit 3D conformation optimization
- Break up generator objects in merge_template_peptide into smaller pieces for running on hoffman2.
    Parallel code causing non-fatal errors. Look into implementing parallel code with generators. Might want to implement a class to parallelize things.
    Also might want to parallelize writing to file, since for loop doesnt look like it is going fast enough.
- Add rare amino acids to monomers
- Add database connections to diversify_side_chains.py and generate_monomers.py
- Add side chains from data to side chain pool (5-fluoro-trp, etc...)
- Look into using mySQL instead of MongoDB
- Add unit tests
- fix filepaths within project
- Use constants for hardcoded values in scripts
- Change heats in regioSQM filter to 3 decimal places
- Switch to storing kekulize smiles strings in DB / Get molecules to render without circle for aromaticity
    Kekuleized reaction smarts cant be run with rdkit chemical reactions. Need to store both Kekule smiles and canonical smiles in db. temporary fix is continue to use canonical smiles
    and kekulize smiles when making presentations. Need to think about how to store kekulize smiles in db (relational db)?
- Check conditions for indole_hetero_atoms_filter() in apply_filters.py and check conditions for filtering bicyclic 5 membered rings
