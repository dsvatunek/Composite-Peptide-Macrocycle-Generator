- Switch to storing kekulize smiles strings in DB / Get molecules to render without circle for aromaticity
- Implement mechanism for tryptophan connection at amide nitrogen
- Add filter for accepting reactions at hetero atoms in bicyclic (5 merged with 6 membered rings; tryptophan derivatives) rings.
- 3D rendering; look into pymol and using coordinate matricies from rdkit 3D conformation optimization
- Spartan / conformational analysis
- Break up generator objects in generate_peptide and merge_template_peptide into smaller pieces for running on hoffman2. Also look into parallelizing the programs
- Add rare amino acids to monomers
- Add side chains from data to side chain pool (5-fluoro-trp, etc...)
- Let primary amines in general form connection between template and peptide (not just N-terminus)
- Look into using mySQL instead of MongoDB
- Clean up filter_regio.py
- Add unit tests
- fix filepaths within project
- Use constants for hardcoded values in scripts
- Change heats in regioSQM filter to 3 decimal places
