- Implement mechanism for tryptophan connection at amide nitrogen
- 3D rendering; look into pymol and using coordinate matricies from rdkit 3D conformation optimization
- Spartan / conformational analysis
- Break up generator objects in generate_peptide and merge_template_peptide into smaller pieces for running on hoffman2. Also look into parallelizing the programs
- Add rare amino acids to monomers
- Add side chains from data to side chain pool (5-fluoro-trp, etc...)
- Let primary amines in general form connection between template and peptide (not just N-terminus)
- Look into using mySQL instead of MongoDB
- Add unit tests
- fix filepaths within project
- Use constants for hardcoded values in scripts
- Change heats in regioSQM filter to 3 decimal places
- Switch to storing kekulize smiles strings in DB / Get molecules to render without circle for aromaticity
    Kekuleized reaction smarts cant be run with rdkit chemical reactions. Need to store both Kekule smiles and canonical smiles in db. temporary fix is continue to use canonical smiles
    and kekulize smiles when making presentations. Need to think about how to store kekulize smiles in db (relational db)?
- Check conditions for indole_hetero_atoms_filter() in apply_filters.py and check conditions for filtering bicyclic 5 membered rings
